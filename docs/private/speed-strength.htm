<h1>Speed and Strength Exercises</h1>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=Heading2Char><span style='font-size:13.0pt;
line-height:115%'>Here are the three classic moves</span></span>:<br>
<span class=Heading3Char>1- Squats</span><br>
<span class=Heading3Char>2- Plyometric box jumps</span><br>
<span class=Heading3Char>3- Pushups</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><img width=250 height=165 id="Picture 1"
src="speed-strength_files/image001.jpg" alt="Description: push-up"></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=Heading3Char>Squats</span><br>
Take some time to learn how to perform a squat correctly as this set up will
serve you well! A proper foundation of good form is the best way to get maximum
results from performing squats while avoiding injury. Of the 3 moves the squat
will take the most time to perfect.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>Here is a good description of how to properly perform a
squat:</i><br>
Begin by standing with your feet shoulder to hip width apart, toes pointed
slightly outward. Stand up straight with your shoulders back and a slight curve
in your lower back. Keep your body weight in your heels and the slight curve in
your lower back throughout the movement. Look straight ahead or slightly
upward. Squat down by sending your butt back and descend, as if you were
sitting down in a chair. Your knees should never move in front of your toes.
Lower your butt until it is parallel with your knees, or just slightly below
your knees. If this is too difficult, squat only to the point of your current
range of motion. Reverse the movement and come to a standing position, fully
opening your hip and knee joints. Repeat.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For the purposes of this series we&#39;ll be doing squats
without weight. Why? In order to increase your speed. This workout is geared to
make you faster. The joint and full body muscle strengthening are the happy
side effects!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=Heading3Char>Plyometric Box Jumps</span><br>
Start with a 12&#34; high Plyometric box. Jump onto it with both feet and land
softly. Step backwards one foot at a time off the box. Repeat. You&#39;ll see videos
that show people jumping onto and backwards off the box with both feet. Since
the benefit of the jump is in the spring onto the box, it&#39;s best to go down
carefully to avoid injury. When 12&#34; gets too easy, add height in 3&#34; increments.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=Heading3Char>Pushups</span><br>
If you&#39;re already able to perform a pushup, try an inverted pushup with your
feet on the 12&#34; plyo box and your hands on the floor. Otherwise do your pushups
on the floor in the standard way. Keep your hands at chest/shoulder level or
the pushups will become more difficult to execute. Use your abs as well as your
upper body strength to push up from the floor.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If you&#39;re unable to perform a full pushup then it is
critical that you work on this move. Pushups can be done with the knees on the
floor instead of the feet, or against a wall from a standing position. Even if
you&#39;re only able to perform one full pushup in the traditional manner you
should start with that and then use the modified position to complete the
repeats. Anyone who considers him or herself an athlete should be able to
execute pushups in the traditional manner because it is an absolute baseline
exercise for upper body strength.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=Heading2Char><span style='font-size:13.0pt;
line-height:115%'>Here&#39;s the routine:</span></span><br>
<span class=Heading3Char>15 squats<br>
10 12&#34; plyo box jumps<br>
10 pushups</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Repeat for 3 sets with anywhere from 30 seconds to 2 minutes
rest in between sets. You should be breathing pretty heavily at the end of each
set. If not, increase your speed. Do each set as quickly as possible and for
time if you want to record your progress.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Make adjustments as the routine gets easier. Add an
additional set. Increase the height of the plyo box. Increase the number of
repeats. In the same way, if this routine feels too difficult decrease the
number of repeats or use a lower plyo box. It&#39;s best to do at least 3 sets at
the level you are able to execute.</p>
