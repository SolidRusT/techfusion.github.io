<p class=MsoTitle>101 Ways to Lose Your Gut</p>

</div>

and over time, you'll bury your belly forever.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i><span style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:115%'>By Adam
Campbell and Brian Good</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The average man's body houses 43.2 pounds of fat. And at any
one moment, that number is either increasing or decreasing—it's never stagnant.
Spend more of each day burning fat than you do storing it, and over time,
you'll bury your belly forever. Sound simple? It is. You see, there's no single
secret formula for losing fat. In fact, find 100 successful losers and they'll
give you 100 different ways to win the battle of the bulge. But we did them one
better. On the following pages, you'll find 101 tips designed to help you lose
your love handles, bust your gut, and define your abs. Simply incorporate three
or four into your life every day, and you'll finish off your fat easier and
faster than you ever imagined possible.</p>

<h2>Eat more protein.</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>About 25%-30% of the calories in each gram of protein are
burned in digestion, compared to only 6%-8% of the calories in carbs. Do the
math: You save 41 calories every time you substitute 50 grams of protein for an
equal amount of carbs.</p>

<h2>Read labels.</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>Avoid foods with &quot;high-fructose corn syrup&quot; in the
ingredients list. Since 1971, consumption of this sugar substitute—which is
used to sweeten soda, commercial baked goods, and even condiments—has increased
more than 350% in the U.S., paralleling the rise in obesity.</p>

<h2>Get off your ass.</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>Do every exercise standing instead of sitting. &quot;You'll
expend up to 30% more calories,&quot; says Joe Stankowski, C.P.T. The solution
for the bench press? Dips.</p>

<h2>Mix up your movements.</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>When you lift, perform supersets in which you alternate
between sets of lower-body and upper-body exercises. That way, your lower body
rests while your upper body is working. &quot;This allows you to work your
muscles maximally with very little downtime between sets for a faster, more
effective workout,&quot; says Craig Ballantyne, C.S.C.S.</p>

<h2>Exercise blind.</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>When you're using the elliptical trainer, try letting go of
the handles and closing your eyes. (Be careful!) Without the visual feedback,
your core muscles will have to work harder to keep you balanced, burning more
calories.</p>

<h2>Embrace yardwork.</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>View any type of physical activity—even those you try to
avoid, such as mowing the lawn—as a chance to burn fat and condition your body.
(Just make sure you use a push mower.)</p>

<h2>Snack on dill pickles.</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>They have one calorie per slice.</p>

<h2>Take larger steps.</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>When using the stair climber, skip one out of every five
steps. Then take one large step to get back to your normal walking pattern.
This step recruits additional muscle, upping fat loss, says Cameron McGarr,
C.S.C.S.</p>

<h2>Rent motivation.</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>Once a week, watch a movie that inspires you to exercise.
Examples: Rocky (for the gym), American Flyers (for cycling), Hoosiers (for
team sports), and Chariots of Fire and Without Limits (both for running).</p>

<h2>Break a record.</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>Challenge yourself to run farther in the same amount of
time—even if it's just one-tenth of a mile—every single workout. This ensures
you're always burning more calories from one workout to the next.</p>

<h2>Smash your dinner plates.</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>And buy smaller ones. That way, even if you fill your plate
to capacity, you're ultimately eating less than what you would likely pile on
your existing platters.</p>

<h2>Cut carbs.</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>Yes, you've heard it a zillion times. The reason: It works.
In just one of many recent studies, a Journal of Nutrition report found that
men who reduced their carb intake to just 8% of their daily calories lost seven
pounds of fat and gained two pounds of muscle in six weeks.</p>

<h2>Lift first, then run.</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>By doing cardio after you've lifted—when you're already
tired—the same speed or intensity will have a greater effect than had you done
it beforehand, says McGarr.</p>

<h2>Change directions.</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>Try this interval-training trick on the elliptical trainer:
Ride for 30 seconds as fast as you can, then immediately reverse your direction
and ride for 30 additional seconds just as fast in the opposite direction. Rest
60 seconds and repeat. The force of stopping your momentum, as well as going
from a dead stop to full speed twice in the same interval, will give your
fat-burning efforts a massive boost, says MF training adviser Alwyn Cosgrove,
C.S.C.S.</p>

<h2>Fill up on high-fiber foods.</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>Consider them &quot;good carbs.&quot; Their bulk takes up
space in your stomach, helping you feel full and eat less. The top fiber food:
beans, which contain 8 grams per 1/2 cup. Research shows that guys who added 12
grams of fiber a day to their diet lost a quarter of an inch from their love
handles, without otherwise modifying their diet.</p>

<h2>Top your salad with vinaigrette dressing.</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>Studies show that acidic foods such as vinegar and lemon
juice work like lighter fluid in your body's fat incinerator, increasing carb
combustion 20%-40%. Researchers believe the acids blunt insulin spikes and slow
the rate at which food empties from your stomach. Fermented foods like pickles
and yogurt are also good sour options.</p>

<h2>Don't skip meals.</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>Not eating for long periods of time puts your body into a
catabolic state, meaning it starts to break down muscle tissue fo energy— and
conserves fat.</p>

<h2>Try the VersaClimber.</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>The more vertical you are when doing cardio, the more
calories you burn.</p>

<h2>Don't be a couch potato.</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>If you're a TV junkie, add up the number of hours you watch
right now, and cut out all reruns—even if there's an episode of Seinfeld on
you've never seen. Spend the time you save on your feet: outdoors or in the
gym.</p>

<h2>Hit the weights.</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>If you're lazy, it's not as bad as you think—just 10 minutes
a day of lifting, three days a week, will help. Harvard research shows that 30
minutes of weight training per week has a greater reduction on waist size than
almost any other variable.</p>

<h2>Pass on the potatoes.</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>In any form—mashed and baked, as well as French fries and
potato chips. They raise levels of insulin in the blood, triggering your body
to stop burning—and start storing—fat. (Sweet potatoes are acceptable; they
have more nutrients and fiber.)</p>

<h2>Eat your biggest meal of the day after you lift.</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>It takes calories to digest food. And researchers at the
University of Nevada found that it takes 73% more calories to process that food
after a weight-training session than if you hadn't worked out at all.</p>

<h2>Chug H20 before a meal.</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>The water will take up room in your stomach, making you feel
more full and reducing your appetite, says Christopher Mohr, M.S., R.D.</p>

<h2>Request substitutions.</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>Any time your restaurant entree comes with a side of pasta,
potatoes, or rice, ask for vegetables instead, says Jeff Volek, Ph.D., R.D.
(Your server will be more than happy to accommodate you.)</p>

<h2>Join a league.</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>That is, sign up for a sport such as softball, soccer, or
even kickball. It'll automatically schedule exercise sessions into your week,
and because you're part of a team, you'll have peer pressure that'll ensure you
keep showing up.</p>

<h2>Break between scoops.</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>That is, if you can't live without ice cream, cake, or other
calorie-laden desserts, go ahead and have one scoop (about 1/2 cup) or one
small slice. Then, if you still want more, wait 20 minutes. Typically, you'll
find that while you wait, hormones kick in and trigger a feeling of fullness,
reducing desire for that second serving.</p>

<h2>Brush your teeth more often. </h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>In a recent Japanese study of 14,000 people, researchers
found that men who brushed their teeth frequently were leaner than men who did
not. Thank that minty-fresh flavor, which may make you less likely to snack
between meals.</p>

<h2>Eat an unbalanced diet.</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;By cycling your calorie intake so that you eat less
calories one day and more the next, you'll keep your metabolism on its
toes,&quot; says Volek. And that'll ensure you keep burning fat at a high rate.
The key: Shoot for an average of 2,000 calories a day over a week's time.</p>

<h2>Dial up an incline.</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>When you run outside, you apply force to the ground and
propel your body weight forward all by yourself. When you run on a treadmill,
the belt helps you. To counteract this, always walk or run on at least a 1%
incline, the treadmill grade an English study found is nearly equivalent to
outside running.</p>

<h2>Stick to no-calorie drinks.</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>That means coffee, tea, diet soda, mixes such as Crystal
Light and, of course, water.</p>

<h2>Have breakfast every day.</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>Research from Harvard and Boston's Children's Hospital shows
that obesity rates are 35%-50% lower in people who eat breakfast regularly,
compared with folks who don't. Nutritionists believe a.m. meals help regulate
insulin levels and hunger, so you're less likely to overeat throughout the
reminder of the day.</p>

<h2>Avoid foods that come in a bag or box.</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>Typically, these are highly processed carbs—foods that
quickly raise blood-sugar levels and shut down your body's ability to burn fat.</p>

<h2>Snack between meals.</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>This not only keeps you from being ravenous—and
overeating—at lunch and dinner, it forces your body to process food all day
long, which keeps your metabolism stoked.</p>

<h2>Buy a TiVo.</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>And only watch the shows you record. By fast-forwarding
through the commercials, and watching only the shows you care enough to set a
season pass for, you can cut your TV viewing—and the amount of time you spend
on the couch—by more than a third.</p>

<h2>Load up on yogurt.</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>When researchers at the University of Tennessee put a group
of volunteers on one of two diets—one high in calcium and one not—and cut each
group's calorie intake by 500 calories, they found that the people getting
calcium lost twice as much weight (an average of 13 pounds) compared with
people on the standard diet. Study author Michael Zemel, Ph.D., believes extra
calcium helps the body burn more—and store less—fat.</p>

<h2>Order appetizers.</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>And avoid the bread bowl at all costs. If you're ravenous
when you sit down to eat at a restaurant, immediately order a side salad, or a
meat- or vegetable-only appetizer, rather than be tempted by these bottomless
—and fattening—freebies.</p>

<h2>Pop peanuts.</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>Nuts have a very high satiety power—meaning they make you
feel fuller after eating than many other foods. And even though they're high in
calories, those calories appear to be processed differently in the body.
University of Michigan researchers found that men who added 500 calories' worth
of peanuts a day to their diet gained no excess weight at all.</p>

<h2>Track your calories.</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>You could do it in a journal, but we know that's never going
to happen. Instead, do it on the Web, at a site like fitday.com. Just create a
free account, plug in the amounts of food you're eating throughout the day, and
let the software tell you exactly how good—or bad—you're being.</p>

<h2>Do sprint intervals.</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>Interspersing short, all-out sprints with brief periods of
rest is the most effective form of cardio for fat loss, says Stankowski. Try a
2-to-1 &quot;work-to-rest&quot; ratio. That is, sprint two times longer than
you rest. So if you run a 150-yard sprint—a good distance to start with—in 20
seconds, rest 10 seconds, then repeat 3-7 times.</p>

<h2>Check your mood.</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>The desire to snack may not be due to hunger at all, but
rather the result of loneliness, depression, or anxiety. &quot;Emotional eating
is at the core of bad eating choices,&quot; says N.Y.C. psychotherapist
Elizabeth Fagan, C.S.W. If you often find yourself eating when you feel down,
or if you feel happier after a meal, that may signify a problem.</p>

<h2>Shop for one.</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>If you have to buy cookies, chips, or other processed junk
foods, buy the single-serving package—rather than the large, family-style bag.
That way, when you eat the whole package—and let's be honest, you know you
will—you'll at last have done a lot less damage to your waistline.</p>

<h2>Find inspiration. </h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>Take a digital picture of yourself, shirtless, in all your
fat, naked splendor. Then use a photo-editing program on your computer to erase
your love handles and create your own digital &quot;after&quot; shot. (You can
also take a Polaroid of yourself in front of a black background and use a Magic
Marker to thin down your waist.) Post the pictures somewhere you'll see them
often, like on the fridge or in your office at work.</p>

<h2>Go the distance. </h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>Perform intervals for a designated distance rather than a
designated time. Otherwise, you'll be running shorter sprints as you get tired,
reducing the number of calories you burn, says McGarr.</p>

<h2>Cheat once a week.</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>Use the meal as a reward for a week's worth of hard work, or
the completion of a project you've been dreading. &quot;It's OK for people to
blow one meal a week without feeling guilty,&quot; says James W. Anderson,
M.D., director of the Metabolic Research Group at the University of Kentucky in
Lexington. &quot;If you follow a healthy diet 95% of the time, you can relax
and enjoy yourself the other 5% of the time without gaining weight,&quot; he
says.</p>

<h2>Row to the sky.</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>Every time you complete 10 reps on the rowing machine, lift
the handles straight up over your head—without bending your elbows—for two
consecutive repetitions before returning to normal rowing form. This works your
shoulders and back harder, as well as your legs, since they have to produce
more power in order to give you the momentum to perform the move, says McGarr.</p>

<h2>Avoid white bread.</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>When Tufts University researchers studied the waistlines and
diets of 459 people, they found that even in men of similar age and activity
level, those who ate white bread frequently weighed more than those who didn't.
&quot;The calories from white bread and refined grains just seem to settle at
the waistline more than calories from other foods,&quot; says Katherine Tucker,
Ph.D., the study author.</p>

<h2>Keep an eye on portion sizes.</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Most people who have been lean their whole lives have
a much better understanding of proper portion size than people who are
overweight,&quot; says Deborah Riebe, Ph.D., a professor in the department of
kinesiology at the University of Rhode Island. &quot;If they go out to eat,
they're much more likely to ask for a doggie bag right away or to leave food on
their plate rather than cleaning it up,&quot; she says.</p>

<h2>Never forbid yourself a favorite food.</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>Here's a shocker: When a group of U.K. researchers told 30
women to avoid chocolate, then packed them into a room filled with the stuff,
the women were much more likely to sneak a bite than individuals who hadn't
been given the order. Blame the allure of the forbidden: The more you tell
yourself you can't eat something you love, the more you're going to want it.</p>

<h2>Outdo yourself.</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>When you exercise on the rowing machine, try this interval
workout: Row for 60 seconds, note the distance on the machine, then rest 60
seconds. Repeat, only this time, row for 55 seconds and try to match or better
your distance from the first time. Rest 55 seconds, then repeat, reducing the
time to 50 seconds. Continue until you can't beat your original distance.</p>

<h2>Sneak extra activity into your day. </h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>Pace around your office while talking on the phone; run into
the bank to cash your check instead of using the drive-thru. When researchers
at the Mayo Clinic fed a group of volunteers an extra 1,000 calories a day over
the course of eight weeks, they found sedentary individuals gained eight times
more weight than those who fidgeted a lot during the day.</p>

<h2>Turn off The Late Show after the monologue.</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>Or give up the morning visit with Matt and Katie—whatever it
takes to grab a few more minutes of sleep each day. When researchers at the
University of Chicago studied men who were sleep-deprived, they found that
after just a few days, their bodies had a much harder time processing glucose
in the blood—a problem common in overweight diabetics. When the individuals
returned to a more normal seven to eight hours of sleep a night, however, their
metabolisms returned to normal.</p>

<h2>Buy some new blinds.</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>And maybe a new mattress, because it's not just the amount
of time you spend sleeping that keeps you lean, it's also the quality of your
sleep. Fat cells in your body produce a hormone called leptin that helps the
body keep track of how much potential energy (i.e. fat) it has stored. But
leptin is only produced during certain stages of sleep. Miss out on those
stages because you're not resting soundly enough, and you'll disturb levels of
the hormone, leaving your body with no real idea of its energy reserves.
Consequently, you'll end up storing calories rather than burning them.</p>

<h2>Don't starve yourself.</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Under normal conditions, humans absorb only about 80%
of the nutrients from the food they eat,&quot; says A. Roberto Frisancho,
Ph.D., a weight-loss researcher at the University of Michigan. But, he says,
when the body is deprived of nourishment, it becomes a super-efficient machine,
pulling what nutrients it can from whatever food is consumed. Start eating
again normally and your body may not catch up; instead it will continue to
store food as fat.</p>

<h2>Eat more slowly.</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;It can take 12 minutes or longer for the signal that
you've started to eat to make its way to your brain,&quot; says Mark S. Gold,
M.D., of the McKnight Brain Institute at the University of Florida. Quick tips:
Sip some water between every bite of food you eat, or at least eat more meals
with friends or family members. You'll be more likely to talk and therefore to
eat more slowly.</p>

<h2>Floss twice a day.</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>When researchers in Brazil studied 13,000 people over a
three-year period, they found that men with the highest levels of inflammatory
agents in their body were also the most likely to gain weight. And periodontal
disease, which is caused by poor oral health care, is one of the most common
sources of inflammation. Brushing twice a day, flossing, and making regular trips
to the dentist are the best ways to prevent the disease. Hate flossing? Studies
show that a dose of Listerine may be just as effective at reducing levels of
inflammatory bacteria within the mouth.</p>

<h2>Step on the scale at least once a day.</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;If there's one thing that comes up over and over with
the thousands of patients enrolled in the National Weight Control Registry,
it's weighing yourself every day on a scale,&quot; says Rena Wing, Ph.D.,
founder of the registry, which tracks more than 4,500 men and women who have
lost an average of 20 pounds or more and kept it off for at least six years.
&quot;Don't obsess over the number,&quot; she says, &quot;but at least keep
track of the general range of what you weigh so you can catch small changes as
they occur and take corrective measures immediately.&quot;</p>
